<h1>DependenciesAggregationService</h1>

<p>DependenciesAggregationService combines the data from all applicable dependencies services in order to produce 
a single set of dependencies. A dependency is a model paths that points to parts of the model that the property depends on. 
A property listens on all of its dependencies and triggers refresh when any of the dependencies change.</p>

<p>An implementation of this service is provided with Sapphire. This service is not intended to
be implemented by adopters. See <a href="DependenciesService.html">DependenciesService</a> instead.</p>
