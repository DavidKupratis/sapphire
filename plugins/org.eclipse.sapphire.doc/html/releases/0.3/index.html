<h2><a name="html">HTML Content Presentation</a></h2>

<p>It is hard to beat the simplicity and flexibility of HTML for presenting formatted
text content. Now it is even easier to weave in a bit of HTML into a Sapphire UI. The new
HTML part can display static HTML content embedded in an sdef file, content retrieved
from a URL or content retrieved from the model.</p>

<p>Frequently, it is easier to specify HTML content in the form of a fragment rather than a
finished document. Sapphire will automatically turn a fragment into a legal document and apply
default style that is designed to match the look of surrounding UI elements.</p>

<pre class="source-code"><code>&lt;html>
  &lt;fragment>true&lt;/fragment>
  &lt;content>
    Here is the list of ${ Name }'s favorite colors:&amp;lt;br/>&amp;lt;br/>
    &amp;lt;ol>
      &amp;lt;li>Red&amp;lt;/li>
      &amp;lt;li>Orange&amp;lt;/li>
      &amp;lt;li>Blue&amp;lt;/li>
    &amp;lt;/ol>
  &lt;/content>
&lt;/html></code></pre>

<p>Note how HTML tags have to be escaped in order to not be treated as part of the XML
markup of the sdef file. Also note that you are able to use expressions in the body of the
content to enhance the content with data from the model or external sources.</p>

<h2><a name="related-content">Related Content</a></h2>

<p>It is now possible to put related content to the right of a property
editor.</p> 

<p>The space for related content is carved out from the space reserved for
the main property editor. As such, it is bound by the height of that property editor, but
multiple parts can be added to related content as long as vertical space allows. This
can happen if the main property editor is a table or a multi-line text box.</p>

<p>Horizontal space between the main property editor and related content is divided by 
an adjustable splitter. You get to set the initial width allocation for the related 
content in the sdef file. The default is 40, which stands for 40% of available space.</p>  

<p>Use related content to display two property editors on one line. This pattern is especially
powerful when the relationship of two properties is such that a single label will suffice.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><img src="images/related-content-1.png"/></p>

<p>Display more than two parts on one line by nesting related content inside related content. 
Use sparingly.</p>

<p>Related content isn't limited to property editors. Any part can be placed into related
content. This is particularly useful when the main property editor spans more than one
vertical line, such as a list property editor or a multi-line text box. In this example,
related content is used to display explanatory text.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><img src="images/related-content-3.png"/></p>

<p>Multiple parts can be placed into related content. They will be arranged vertically.</p>
