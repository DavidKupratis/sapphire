<p>When a property is described to a user in documentation one does it with a series of short statements that
define its semantics, such as "must be specified" or "maximum value is 100". When a property is
described to Sapphire one does it with a series of annotations, such as @Required or
@NumericRange. This duplicate specification is a maintenance problem.</p>

<p>A FactsService provides a means to dynamically derive statements about property's semantics
based on property's metadata. The derived facts can then be presented to the user as part of documentation,
property editor information popup and in other relevant places.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><img src="images/FactsService.png"/></p>

<p>The concept of deriving facts from metadata has existed in limited capacity in past releases.
New for 0.4 is formalization of this system via FactsService API that allows adopters to participate
in generation of facts on equal footing with the framework. Also new for 0.4 is a much longer list
of annotations that generate corresponding facts.</p>
